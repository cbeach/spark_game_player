#Spark Streaming Game Player
## TODO
* Start on video game gdl
* Isolate more sprites from the frame data.
* Modify Nestopia to allow headless play at an increased frame rate.
    * Integrate server, but keep graphics display
    * Ppu.output.pixels might be what I'm looking for
* Figure out how to identify partially hidden tiles/sprites
* Train Tesseract to recognize text on the Nintendo.
* Produce a stitched together image of an entire level
